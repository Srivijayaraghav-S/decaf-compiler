# Building DECAF Compiler
The project on building a compiler for the DECAF programming language is aimed at creating an efficient and robust compiler for a simplified, educational-purpose language. DECAF, resembling languages like C/C++/Java in its structure and concepts, focuses on object-oriented principles and strong typing. This project covers all phases of compiler construction, from lexical analysis and parsing to code generation and optimization, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of compiler design and the complexities of language processing. The development also includes the creation of sample programs to validate and demonstrate the compiler's functionality.
